/**
 * @animateicons/react build config.
 *
 * - Entries: a top-level `index` (types only - see below) plus `lucide`
 *   and `huge` deep imports. Per-icon tree-shaking comes for free with
 *   ESM + sideEffects: false.
 * - "use client" banner: every output chunk needs the directive so Next
 *   App Router consumers don't need to add their own wrapper.
 * - Aliases: each icon source file imports `@/lib/utils` and
 *   `@/types/icon` from the AnimateIcons monorepo. Esbuild rewrites
 *   them to the package-local versions during bundling.
 * - react / react-dom stay external (peer deps). motion is intentionally
 *   bundled into dist so consumers install a single package and never
 *   hit a dual-package hazard from their own motion version.
