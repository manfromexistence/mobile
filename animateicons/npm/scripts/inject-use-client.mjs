/**
 * Post-build: prepend `"use client";` to every entry file in dist/.
 *
 * Why this script exists:
 *   tsup's `banner: { js }` option intermittently drops the directive
 *   when esbuild splits shared code into a chunk file (we have one:
 *   `chunk-*.js` for the inlined `cn` helper). Without "use client"
 *   at the top of each entry, Next.js App Router treats the icons as
 *   server components and crashes on `useRef`/`useAnimation`.
 *
 * We don't add the banner to the chunk file itself - chunks are
 * imported by the entries and inherit their environment.
 *
 * Idempotent: skips files that already start with the directive.
